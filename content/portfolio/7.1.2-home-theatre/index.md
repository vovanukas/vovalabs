shortDescription: This project required me to create a 7.1.2 home theatre set-up with limited materials available local to
  the seller. I have been able to follow Dolby recommendations for the speaker placements and have conducted thorough acoustic calculations to achieve great sound quality.
challenge: To create an excellent home cinema that adheres to the Dolby specifications and has perfect reverberation time
  and frequency response.
solution: The usage of an acoustically transparent screen allowed me to place the central speaker in front of the
  the listeners. Resulting in perfectly direct and clear sound.
