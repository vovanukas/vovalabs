service: Acoustic Design, Interior Design
client: Fiverr @ Panashefusion
shortDescription: This client had an office space, which he wanted to convert into a professional
  recording studio. The space was completely empty, so it was a design, which I had to come up with
  from the grounds up. Since the studio had unfortunate room ratios and thus we had to add an extra
  wall to make the room smaller. We have used that space perfectly for storage.
challenge: To create an aesthetically and functional studio. To come up with a way to correct the
  room ratios and how to use the space that was sacrificed.
solution: Aesthetics were combined with function with WoodUpp acoustic panels. The room ratios were corrected with a wall addition, which was converted into storage area.
